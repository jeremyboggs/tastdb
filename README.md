# Transatlantic Slave Trade Data

This repo includes
- CSV output of the [Expanded Dataset (2016 SPSS
format)](http://slavevoyages.org/voyage/download)
- places.csv, which is a simple reference table of port numbers and
place names.
- tastdb.py, a script that parses the expanded dataset and (currently)
generates a report of totals by port for the 18th century.
